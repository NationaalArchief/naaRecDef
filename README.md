# naaRecDef

This repository holds different versions of the Nationaal Archief Record Definition used to produce RDF for *Additional Finding-aids* and *photo collections*.

The main directory holds the working version **0.0.0**. When a version is ready to be plublished a copy is made to the **published** directory and a *git tag* is made.
The reason for this setups is that numbered versions are used in the ingestion workflow and we want to keep a uninterrupted history of version changes for the master file.
